# Analysing the impact of public sentiment towards Bitcoin on its value using Twitter data: A Sentiment Analysis Approach

> :information_source: **This project was created as part of my undergraduate dissertation.**

Since their inception in 2009 with the creation of Bitcoin, cryptocurrencies have rapidly increased in popularity as an alternative digital form of currency, utilising cryptography to secure unit creation and transactions. However, as the cryptocurrency market is highly volatile, many adopt them not as a genuine attempt to challenge the status quo of traditional financial systems, but instead as an opportunity to carry out short-term, high-risk, high reward investing. 

This project aims to investigate one of the potential causes of this volatility, the sentiment towards Bitcoin, by conducting sentiment analysis on the Twitter social media platform to determine the existence of a correlation between the overall sentiment towards Bitcoin and its market value. Additionally, the project also aims to investigate the potential impact of tweet popularity on the strength of this correlation. 

The resulting findings could potentially be leveraged by both new and current investors to make informed investment decisions that align with market trends, leading to improved investment returns. The strength of this correlation was evaluated using time-series visualisation and manual data analysis to identify any notable trends or similarities between patterns in the two variables. 

The results indicated that, while there may be some correlation between the fluctuations in Bitcoinâ€™s value and the sentiment towards it, potentially allowing for it to be utilised to predict the market trajectory, this correlation does not extend to the magnitude of changes in the Bitcoin market.
